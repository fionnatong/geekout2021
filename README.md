# Final challenge - Geekout 2021 Web Development Workshop

:tada:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratualations for making it this far!

:computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this final challenge, you will be building YOUR very own application!

:muscle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst Singapore's fight against the pandemic, the series of GoWhere websites has provided citizens with helpful information on where to obtain essential products or services. An example would be the [SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/) website which catalogues a list of government grants for individuals in need of financial support. Other examples include [MaskGoWhere](https://mask.gowhere.gov.sg/) and [FluGoWhere](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/).

:ghost:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Our challenge to you is to create your own (X)GoWhere website where (X) can be anything you think might contribute to the 'public good' (e.g. VaccinationGoWhere, MemeGoWhere...)__

:camera:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you are done building your (X)GoWhere website, take a screenshot and upload it along with your name onto this Trello board here. We will then vote for the website that you like the most.

:raised_hands:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, we will be starting with a code template and there will be instructions to guide along the way. Should you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reach out to your amazing mentors.

## Bonus: Host your Website Publicly

Currently, your website can only be seen by you and only you. If you would like to share your website with your family and friends, you need to host your website on a public domain. Netlify has an option to manually deploy your website to their public domain. You can follow the instructions in the video below (Note: You need to create an account on Netlify)
