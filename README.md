# Final challenge - Geekout 2021 Web Development Workshop

Congratualations for making it this far! :tada: In this final challenge, you will be building YOUR very own application!

Amidst Singapore's fight against the pandemic, the series of GoWhere websites has provided citizens with helpful information on where to obtain essential products or services. An example would be the [SupportGoWhere](https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/) website which catalogues a list of government grants for individuals in need of financial support. Other examples include [MaskGoWhere](https://mask.gowhere.gov.sg/) and [FluGoWhere](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/).

Our challenge to you is to create your own (X)GoWhere website where (X) can be anything you think might contribute to the public good.

Don't worry, we will be providing a template to get you started and there will be step-by-step instructions along the way. Should you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reach out to your amazing mentors.
